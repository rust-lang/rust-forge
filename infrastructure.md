# Rust Infrastructure

Most services in the Rust Infrastructure are deployed via
[rust-central-station][]. Questions about infrastructure, including current
status, should go to the #rust-infra IRC channel.

**Our stability guarantees**: many of our services rely on publicly-accessible
storage and APIs, but not all of these are intended for public consumption. At
the moment, **only the resources behind `static.rust-lang.org` are considered
stable**, meaning that those resources will not change without (at least) prior
notice. If you are relying on other parts of the Rust project infrastructure for
your own work, please let the infrastructure team know.

## Highfive

[Highfive](https://github.com/rust-lang/highfive) is a bot
([bot user account](https://github.com/rust-highfive)) which welcomes newcomers
and assigns reviewers.

## Homu

[Homu](http://github.com/barosl/homu/) is a bot
([bot user account](https://github.com/bors)) which manages pull requests.
Approved pull requests are placed in
[a queue](http://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust) from which tests are
run.

Documentation on homu commands can be found
[here](http://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/).

Please contact [Alex Crichton](https://github.com/alexcrichton) if something
goes wrong with the bot.

## rfcbot

[rfcbot](https://github.com/dikaiosune/rust-dashboard) is a bot
([bot user account](https://github.com/rfcbot)) which helps manage async
decision making on issues and PRs (typically RFCs). Team members can view any
pending requests for review on [the FCP dashboard](http://rusty-dash.com/fcp).

Documentation on rfcbot commands can be found
[in the dashboard repository](https://github.com/dikaiosune/rust-dashboard/blob/master/RFCBOT.md).

An overview of the current RFCs can be found [here](https://rfcbot.rs).

Please contact [Adam Perry](https://github.com/dikaiosune) ("dikaiosune" on IRC)
if something goes wrong with the bot, or open an issue on
[the dashboard repository](https://github.com/dikaiosune/rust-dashboard/).

## nagbot

[nagbot](https://github.com/aturon/nag-rs) is a bot that emails Rust team
members to nag them for reviews. Please contact
[Aaron Turon](https://github.com/aturon) ("aturon" on IRC) if something goes
wrong with the bot, or open an issue on
[its repo](https://github.com/aturon/nag-rs).

## DXR

[DXR](https://dxr.mozilla.org/rust/source/) is a cross-referenced source index
for Rust, allowing the Rust source tree to be navigated and searched with ease.
It is generated by [rust-dxr](https://github.com/nrc/rust-dxr)

## perf

[perf](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf) offers information about the performance of `rustc` over time.

It is split into a data [collector](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector) and a [web frontend](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/tree/master/site). The raw performance data is available [here](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-timing) and can be browsed on the [perf website](https://perf.rust-lang.org).

## rust release explorer

[rust release explorer](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/rust-release-explorer/) is a way to explore rust release features based on milestone labels. The website can be found [here](https://ashleygwilliams.github.io/rust-release-explorer).

## Rust Playground

[Rust Playground](https://github.com/integer32llc/rust-playground) allows you to experiment with Rust before you install it locally, or in any other case where you might not have the compiler available. The Rust playground can be accessed [here](https://play.rust-lang.org).

## Crater

[Crater](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/crater) is a tool to run experiments across the whole Rust ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to detect regressions in the Rust compiler, and it does this by building large number of crates, running their test suites and comparing the results between two versions of the Rust compiler.
