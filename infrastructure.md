# Rust Infrastructure

Most services in the Rust Infrastructure are deployed via [rust-central-station][].

## DXR

[DXR](https://dxr.mozilla.org/rust/source/) is a cross-referenced source index for Rust, allowing the Rust source tree to be navigated and searched with ease. It is generated by [rust-dxr](https://github.com/nrc/rust-dxr)

## Highfive

[Highfive](https://github.com/nrc/highfive) is a bot ([bot user account](https://github.com/rust-highfive)) which welcomes newcomers and assigns reviewers. It is run by [https://github.com/nrc](Nick Cameron)

## Homu

[Homu](http://github.com/servo/homu/) is a bot ([bot user account](https://github.com/bors)) which manages pull requests. Approved pull requests are placed in [a queue](http://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust) from which tests are run.

Documentation on homu commands can be found [here](http://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/). If you wish to use a similar bot for your own repository, try out [bors-ng](https://bors.tech/).

Please contact [Alex Crichton](https://github.com/alexcrichton) if something goes wrong with the bot.

## rfcbot

[rfcbot](https://github.com/dikaiosune/rust-dashboard) is a bot ([bot user account](https://github.com/rfcbot)) which helps manage async decision making on issues and PRs (typically RFCs). Team members can view any pending requests for review on [the FCP dashboard](http://rusty-dash.com/fcp).

Documentation on rfcbot commands can be found [in the dashboard repository](https://github.com/dikaiosune/rust-dashboard/blob/master/RFCBOT.md).

Please contact [Adam Perry](https://github.com/dikaiosune) ("dikaiosune" on IRC) if something goes wrong with the bot, or open an issue on [the dashboard repository](https://github.com/dikaiosune/rust-dashboard/).

## nagbot

[nagbot](https://github.com/aturon/nag-rs) is a bot that emails Rust team members to nag them for reviews. Please contact [Aaron Turon](https://github.com/aturon) ("aturon" on IRC) if something goes wrong with the bot, or open an issue on [its repo](https://github.com/aturon/nag-rs).
