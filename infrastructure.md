# Rust Infrastructure

Most services in the Rust Infrastructure are deployed via
[rust-central-station]. Questions about infrastructure, including current
status, should go to the [#infra Discord channel](https://discord.gg/rust-lang).

**Our stability guarantees**: many of our services rely on publicly-accessible
storage and APIs, but not all of these are intended for public consumption. At
the moment, **only the resources behind `static.rust-lang.org` are considered
stable**, meaning that those resources will not change without (at least) prior
notice. If you are relying on other parts of the Rust project infrastructure for
your own work, please let the infrastructure team know.

## Highfive

[Highfive](https://github.com/rust-lang/highfive) is a bot
([bot user account](https://github.com/rust-highfive)) which welcomes newcomers
and assigns reviewers.

## Homu

[Homu](https://github.com/rust-lang/homu/) is a bot
([bot user account](https://github.com/bors)) which manages pull requests.
Approved pull requests are placed in
[a queue](http://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust) from which tests are
run.

Documentation on homu commands can be found
[here](http://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/).

Please contact [Alex Crichton](https://github.com/alexcrichton) if something
goes wrong with the bot.

## rfcbot

[rfcbot](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcbot-rs) is a bot
([bot user account](https://github.com/rfcbot)) which helps manage async
decision making on issues and PRs (typically RFCs). Team members can view any
pending requests for review on [the FCP dashboard](https://rfcbot.rs/).

Documentation on rfcbot commands can be found
[in the rfcbot repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcbot-rs).

## DXR

[DXR](https://dxr.mozilla.org/rust/source/) is a cross-referenced source index
for Rust, allowing the Rust source tree to be navigated and searched with ease.
It is generated by [rust-dxr](https://github.com/nrc/rust-dxr)

## perf

[perf](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf) offers information
about the performance of `rustc` over time.

It is split into a data [collector] and a [web frontend]. The raw performance
data is available [here](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-timing)
and can be browsed on the [perf website](https://perf.rust-lang.org).

[collector]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector
[web frontend]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/tree/master/site

## Rust Playground

[Rust Playground](https://github.com/integer32llc/rust-playground) allows you
to experiment with Rust before you install it locally, or in any other case
where you might not have the compiler available. The Rust playground can be
accessed [here](https://play.rust-lang.org).

## Crater

[Crater](https://github.com/rust-lang/crater) is a tool to run
experiments across the whole Rust ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to detect
regressions in the Rust compiler, and it does this by building large number of
crates, running their test suites and comparing the results between two
versions of the Rust compiler.

## docs.rs

[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/) builds and serves the rustdoc documentation for
all crates on [crates.io]. Issues may be filed on the [docs.rs
repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs). See the #docs-rs channel on
Discord for discussion or urgent issues.
