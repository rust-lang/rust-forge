# Rustdoc
Rust's rustdoc team members are responsible for maintaining the Rustdoc tool, improving its performance
and considering the stabilization of rustdoc features.

We use the Forge to document the team's processes, policies and working practices, if you'd like to
read about how the compiler and rustdoc work and instructions on how to set up a development environment,
you're looking for the [rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/rustdoc.html).
