# Meetings

The rustdoc team hosts a meeting every second Monday on each month on the 
[t-rustdoc/meetings channel on zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/393423-t-rustdoc.2Fmeetings)
at 21:00 CET (UTC+1) and CEST on summer (UTC+2).

A new thread is open a month ahead of time to remind people who want to attend about the time
and the agenda.

Anyone is open to participate to the meetings.

If you want to add items to the agenda but you are not a member of the rustdoc team, please comment
on the Zulip thread for the next meeting about the items you want to see discussed. A member of the
rustdoc team will take a look and decide if they can be added to the agenda and what their priority
is. If the item was already discussed, they will provide either explanations or a link to where the
previous discussion happened.
