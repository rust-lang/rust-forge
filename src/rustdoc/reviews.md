# Review Policy

The rustdoc team follows the same review policy as the compiler team. Take a look at
[their chapter](../compiler/reviews.md) about it.

In addition, it's important to note that:
 * Anyone is welcome to provide their input as code review, even if you aren't a member of the
   rustdoc team.
 * Only team members can approve pull requests for being merged.
 * New features are usually subject to more in depth review and might need to go through an RFC or
   an FCP.
