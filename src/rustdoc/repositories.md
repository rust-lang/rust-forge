# Repositories maintained by the Rustdoc Team

<!-- FIXME(fmease): Polish this -->

While the [rust-lang/rust] repository has the majority of the code for the rustdoc tool, there are a handful of additional repositories with other crates/dependencies that the rustdoc team are responsible for:

To ensure that the team is able to respond to urgent issues that originate in any of these repositories, all members of the rustdoc team have access to create and merge pull requests. However, each repository typically has team members who are the most familiar with the repository and act as its primary maintainers.

- The [`rustc` development guide][rustc-dev-guide], the entrypoint documentation for those interested in hacking the compiler. <!-- FIXME(fmease): Tweak wording (comaintained) -->
- [rustdoc-types] <!-- FIXME(fmease): Description -->
- Forge <!-- FIXME(fmease): Description (comaintained) -->

You can see the full list [here](https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/teams/rustdoc/repositories).

If you want to start (or are already) contributing to the Rust project and you have expertise or interest in any of these repositories, feel free to get in touch!
