# Triagebot

Triagebot (AKA rustbot) is a general-purpose bot used for a wide variety of tasks in the rust-lang organization, usually involving sending commands via GitHub or Zulip comments.
The following pages explain the available features.

Commands are usually issued by writing comments starting with the text `@rustbot`.
The commands that are available depends on which repository you are using.
Each repository has a `triagebot.toml` where you can see which features are enabled.

For example, the following comment:

```text
@rustbot label A-diagnostics A-macros
```

will set the given labels on a GitHub issue or pull request, even for people who don't have direct permissions to do that in the GitHub UI.

## GitHub commands

Commands on GitHub issues or pull requests are usually issued by writing `@rustbot` followed by the command anywhere in the comment.
`@rustbot` will ignore commands in markdown code blocks, inline code spans, or blockquotes.
Multiple rustbot commands can be entered in a single comment.

Triagebot also allows editing of a comment.
If you don't modify the text of the command, then triagebot will ignore the edit.
However, if you modify an existing command, or add new ones, then those commands will be processed.

## Configuration

Individual GitHub repositories can configure triagebot features via a file called `triagebot.toml` in the root of the default branch.
The following pages explain the syntax needed for each feature.

For example, the `rust-lang/rust` configuration file is at <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/triagebot.toml>.

When first adding `triagebot.toml` to a new repository, you will need to ping `@simulacrum` on the [`#t-infra`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/242791-t-infra) Zulip stream to enable the relevant permissions for the automation on the repository.
