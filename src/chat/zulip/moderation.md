# Zulip Moderation

Zulip, like all official Rust spaces, is governed by the [Code of
Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). If you have
concerns, please feel free to escalate to the moderation team.

However, though the moderation team is the top-level body here, it is not the
only place where you can seek help with moderation within Zulip.

One method for reaching the Zulip administrators privately is to email
`zulip-admin.239bd484c0347d2d43214d8581f3e125.show-sender@streams.zulipchat.com`.
See [this page](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/help/message-a-stream-by-email)
for details on how this works.

You can also ping the `@mods` group on Zulip; note that this will be public.

It is not currently possible for normal users to self-administrate (e.g., muting
another user). However, each individual stream, including private streams, can
be muted:

## For admins/moderators

Some common actions for moderators are listed [on this
page](https://zulipchat.com/help/moderating-open-organizations).

Notably,
 * in ["Organization permissions"](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#organization/organization-permissions)
   we can restrict users to mandate invitations before joining (this is the "no new users" button)

New admins/moderators should add themselves to the `mods` group on Zulip. (Note
that this is something that any user can do!)
