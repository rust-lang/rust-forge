# Rollup Procedure

## Background

The Rust project has a policy that every pull request must be tested after merge
before it can be pushed to master. As PR volume increases, this can scale poorly,
especially given the long (~3.5hr) current CI duration for Rust.

Enter rollups! Changes that are small, not performance sensitive, or not platform
dependent are marked with the `rollup` command to bors (`@bors r+ rollup` to
approve a PR and mark it as a rollup, `@bors rollup` to mark a previously approved
PR, `@bors rollup-` to un-mark as a rollup).  'Performing a Rollup' then means
collecting these changes into one PR and merging them all at once. The rollup
command accepts four values: `always`, `maybe`, `iffy`, and `never`. See [the
Rollups section] of the review policies for guidance on what these different
statuses mean.

You can see the list of rollup PRs on Rust's [Homu queue], they are
listed at the bottom of the 'approved' queue with a priority of 'rollup' meaning
they will not be merged by themselves until everything in front of them in the
queue has been merged.

## Making a Rollup

1. Using the interface on [Homu queue], select pull requests and then
   use "rollup" button to make a rollup pull request.

   **Important note**:  consider for addition PRs marked as
   `rollup=always`, `rollup=maybe` and `rollup=iffy`, based on the
   review policies of [the Rollups section].  Be extra careful when
   deciding what to include, in particular on `rollup=maybe` and
   `rollup=iffy` PRs. We should try as much as possible to avoid risking
   to hit regressions (bugs or perf).  Also consider that contributors
   often forget to tag things with rollup=never, when they should have
   done so, so when PRs are not explicitly tagged with rollup, be extra
   careful. Also carefully consider the area of the compiler the PRs touch.
   Two diagnostic PRs may actually conflict with each other, as they both 
   change compiler output, which causes failures in each other's tests, 
   when both of them are merged together in a rollup without causing git merge-conflicts.
   In this case the older PR should be given the privilege to merge first 
   and the newer PR should then be rebased as needed.

2. Run the following command in the pull request thread:

   ```
   @bors r+ rollup=never p=5
   ````

   Tools and subtree syncs should use `p=5`, like rollups, so they interleave between rollups, as
   tools and subtree syncs are typically more tricky to fix than rebasing PRs.

3. If the rollup fails, use the logs rust-log-analyzer
   provides to bisect the failure to a specific PR and
   `@bors r-` the PR. If the PR is running, you need to do `@bors r- retry`. Otherwise,
   your rollup succeeded. If it did, proceed to the next rollup (every now and
   then let `rollup=never/iffy` and toolstate PRs progress).
4. Recreate the rollup without the offending PR starting again from **1.**. 
   There's a link in the rollup PR's body to automatically prefill the rollup UI 
   with the existing PRs (minus any PRs that have been `r-`d)
   Try avoiding adding any additional PR to the current "batch" as this
   unnecessarily increases the chance of test failures.
   Rollups should not overlap, if a PR is already contained in a rollup that is not closed,
   it should not be added to another different rollup at the same time.
   If a rollup fails and you are not sure which PR caused the problem, 
   you may bisect the rollup and split it up into two rollups until the offending PR becomes clear.

## Selecting Pull Requests

The queue is sorted by rollup status. In general:

- A good rollup contains a bunch of `maybe` (unmarked) PRs, and a large pile of `always` PRs. You
  can include one or two `iffy` PRs to amortize the cost of testing full CI.
- If you have a lot of time, you can also make a rollup just from `iffy` PRs (if there are enough of
  them) and weed out the failures one by one.
- A rollup must **never** include `rollup=never` PRs.

The actual absolute size of the rollup can depend based on experience and current length of the queue.
People new to making rollups might start with including 1 `iffy`, 2 `maybe`s, and 4 `always`s. Usually 6-8 PRs per rollup is a good compromise.
There is rarely a need to roll up more than 10 PRs at once (unless there are >30 PRs waiting the queue), keep in mind that we also try to minimize regressions per merge.

Limit the size of rollups, *even if* the queue is backed up. Large rollups run the risk of failing
or merge conflicts, and smaller rollups keep potential regressions [bisectable]. On average, rollups
are 7 PRs large, often varying from 5 to 10 depending on the number of `rollup=always` PRs that can
be included.

Don't hesitate to downgrade the rollup status of a PR! If your intuition tells you that a `rollup=always` PR has some chances for failures, mark it `rollup=maybe` or better `rollup=iffy`. A lot of the unmarked `maybe` PRs are categorized as such because the reviewer may not have considered rollupability, so it's always worth picking them with a critical eye. Similarly, if a PR causes your rollup to fail, it's worth considering changing its rollup status.

Generally, PRs that touch CI configuration or the bootstrapping process are probably `iffy` or `never` and should be handled with care. On the other hand, PRs that just edit docs are usually `rollup=always`.

Avoid having too many PRs with large diffs or subtree changes in the same rollup. Self-contained submodule changes (such as `miri` updates) on the other hand may be fine to be rolled up with other unrelated PRs.
Also avoid having PRs you suspect will have large perf impacts and mark them as `rollup=never`.

If an `iffy` PR keeps failing in a rollups, it should be marked `never` to prevent it from causing further problems inside unrelated rollups. This will also cause it to bump up in front of all `maybe`s in the queue and the author will get feedback quicker in case of subsequent failures.
It should be noted which runner the PR failed on, to run this runner as a `try-job` job and make sure it succeeds there before another merge is attempted (example on syntax [here]).
In general, if possible, try to test a failed PR via a handful of carefully selected try-jobs instead of having to run the full battery of all 60 runners on if it's likely a PR may fail again.

To not have `never` or `iffy` PRs stuck in the queue indefinitely, it is recommended to alternate
between rollup and non-rollup prs, so one `never`, one rollup, one `iffy`, one `rollup`, one `never`
etc, until most of the `never`s are merged. You can selectively bump the priority on certain
`iffy`/`never` PRs to `p=1` (or even `p=5`) if you want to interleave them between rollups.

If you are the only person making rollups, you can also leave a couple of `never`/`iffy`s for a time
where you know nobody will be doing rollups actively, or for weekends which generally see a lower
number of PR approvals.

Try to be fair with rollups: Rollups are a way for things to jump the queue. For `rollup=maybe` PRs,
try to include the oldest one (at the top of the section) so that newer PRs aren't jumping the queue
over older PRs perpetually. You don't have to include every PR older than PRs included in your
rollup, but try to include the oldest. Similar to the perspective around `iffy`, it's useful to look
at a rollup as a way for other PRs to piggyback on the CI cycle of the oldest PR in queue.

Very old (several months) or very large PRs that are extremely prone to merge conflicts may also be
given a priority bump (`p=5`) to finally get them out of the queue without having to rebase them
repeatedly, to have the same priority as rollups or sandwich between rollups.

Ultimately, we want to keep the number of regressions per merge at a minimum while also minimizing
the amount of time between approval and the final merge of a PR, to avoid unnecessary merge
conflicts and rebases.

## Failed rollups

If the rollup has failed, run the `@bors retry` command if the
failure was spurious (e.g. due to a network problem or a timeout).
There may be a matching `CI-spurious-fail-.*` label that you can use to tag the PR as such, to help
discover common fail patterns.

If it wasn't spurious, find the offending PR and return it to the author to be fixed by copying a
link to the `rust-log-analyzer` comment, and leaving a comment like

```text
Failed in <link_to_comment>.
@bors r-`.
```

In case `rust-log-analyzer` does not give any meaningful output, you can directly open the ci-logs
(the `(web)` link), find the point where the error was thrown and directly copy the URL to the
respective line in the log output. Hopefully, the author or reviewer will give feedback to get the
PR fixed or confirm that it's not at fault. The failed rollup PR should then be closed.

Once you've removed the offending PR, recreate your rollup without it (see 1.).
Merge one batch of PRs by throwing out the failures one by one instead of adding new PRs to it, as this may introduce additional points of failure.

Sometimes it is hard to find the offending PR. There are usually three strategies to figure out the
offending PR:

1. **Avoid the problem**: Use your intuition to avoid the PRs that you suspect are the problem and
   recreate the rollup.
2. **Test suspected PRs alone**: Raise the priority of the PRs you suspect, mark them as
   `rollup=never` (or `iffy`) and let bors test them standalone to dismiss or confirm your
   hypothesis.
3. **Divide and conquer**: Split rollup into 2 smaller ones until you are certain of the failure
   cause. If a PR was found to be the cause and other PRs were "wrongfully" marked `iffy`, they can
   of course be marked as `maybe` again with `@bors rollup=maybe` or `@bors rollup-`.

If a PR in a rollup continues to fail you can run the `@bors rollup=never` command to ensure the PR
gets tested independently, since it's likely it will fail again in the future.
