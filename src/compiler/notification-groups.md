# Notification groups
The compiler team has a number of notification groups that used to ping people and draw their
attention to issues. Notification groups are setup so that anyone can join them if they want.

## Creating a notification group
If you'd like to create a notification group, here are the steps. First, you want to get approval
from the compiler team:

* File a tracking issue in the [rust-lang/compiler-team] repository to collect your progress.
* Create a PR against the [rust-lang/team] repository adding the notification
  group [(Example PR)](https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/347)
* Configure the [rust-lang/rust] repository to accept triagebot commands
  for this group. [(Example PR.)))](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72706)
* Create a PR for the rustc-dev-guide amending [the notification group
  section](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/notification-groups/about.html)
  to mention your group.
* Create a sample PR for the [rust-lang/team] repository showing how one can add
  oneself. This will be referenced by your blog post to show people how to
  join. [(Example PR)](https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/140)
* Create a Zulip stream for the notification group. If you don't have the permission
  to do, you can ask on [#t-compiler/wg-meta].
* Write an announcement blog post for Inside Rust and open a PR against
  [blog.rust-lang.org](https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org).
