# Compiler
Rust's compiler team are responsible for maintaining the Rust compiler, improving its performance
and considering the stabilization of compiler features.

We use the Forge to document the team's processes, policies and working practices, if you'd like to
read about how the compiler works and instructions on how to set up a development environment,
you're looking for the [rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/).
