# Resources
There are various resources which are useful to contributors and team members.

- [rustc Developer Guide][rustc]
  - Documentation on compiler internals and setting up a developer environment.
- [rustc Generated Documentation][rustc]
  - rustdoc output for the compiler sources
- [FIXMEH][fixmeh]
  - An up-to-date list of all of the `// FIXME` comments in the compiler.

If there are additional resources which would be useful to a contributor or compiler team member,
feel free to submit a PR to add it here.
