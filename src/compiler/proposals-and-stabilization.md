# Proposals, Approvals and Stabilization
It is very common to need to gather feedback and approval when contributing to the compiler, either
for permission to proceed with an experiment or refactoring, or when stabilizing a feature. This
document aims to summarise the various processes that the compiler team has for making approval
decisions and when each should be used.

## Approvals
There are three mechanisms that the team can use to approve a proposal (not all approval mechanisms
are suitable for each method of making a proposal - see below):

- r+
  - A proposal is r+'d when it is approved to be merged.
  - r+ can only be used to approve a PR.
- Seconding
  - A proposal is second'ed when a team member formally endorses the proposal. It is intended that
    seconding only occur once discussion has concluded and team members have had time to raise
    concerns. Seconding tentatively accepts a proposal subject to a ten-day waiting period for
    other team members to raise any concerns.
  - Seconding can only be used to approve a MCP.
- FCP
  - A final comment period will require sign-off from a majority of the compiler team to approve
    a proposal and then a ten day waiting period.
  - FCPs can be used to approve any form of proposal.

## Proposals
There are three ways to propose a change to the compiler team. The appropriate choice depends on
the nature of the proposal, described below.

- Request For Comments (RFC)
  - RFCs are pull requests to the [`rust-lang/rfcs`][rfcs] repository and are a heavy-weight
    proposal mechanism, reserved for significant changes.
  - RFC proposals can only be approved by *FCPs*.
- Major Change Proposal (MCP)
  - MCPs are issues in the [`rust-lang/compiler-team`][mcps] repository and are a medium-weight
    proposal mechanism, suitable for most proposals. MCPs are recommended for written proposals
    that are not end-user facing.
  - Introduced in [RFC 2904][rfc_2904].
  - MCP proposals can be approved by *FCPs* or *Seconding*.
- Pull Request (PR)
  - PRs are pull requests to the [`rust-lang/rust`][rust] repository and are a light-weight
    proposal mechanism, suitable for most proposals. PRs are preferred when the proposal is
    accompanied by a small patchset (such as stabilization of a compiler flag or addition of
    a new target).
  - PR proposals can be approved by *FCPs* or *r+*.

### How do I submit an MCP?

* Open a tracking issue on the [rust-lang/compiler-team] repo using the [major change template].
    * A Zulip topic in the stream `#t-compiler/major changes` will automatically be created for you
      by a bot.
    * If concerns are raised, you may want to modify the proposal to address those concerns.
    * Alternatively, you can submit a [design meeting proposal] to have a longer, focused discussion.
* To be accepted, a major change proposal needs three things:
    * A **second**, a member of the compiler team who approves of the idea, but is not the one
      originating the proposal.
    * A **final comment period** (a 10 day wait to give people time to comment).
        * The FCP can be skipped if the change is easily reversed and/or further objections are
          considered unlikely. This often happens if there has been a lot of prior discussion, for
          example.
* Once the FCP completes, if there are no outstanding concerns, contributions can begin.
    * An earlier accepted MCP is not a substitute for any later necessary approvals.

#### What kinds of comments should go on a MCP in the compiler-team repo?
Please direct technical conversation to the Zulip stream.

The compiler-team repo issues are intended to be low traffic and used for procedural purposes.

It is recommended that any team member who wishes to "second" a proposal be familiar with the
relevant code. Anyone can note concerns that shouldn't be overlooked.

#### How does one second an MCP or raise an objection?
These types of procedural comments can be left on the issue (it's also good to leave a message in
Zulip). See the previous section. To facilitate a machine parsable scanning of the concerns
please use the following syntax to formally register a concern:

```
@rfcbot concern reason-for-concern

<long description of the concern>
```

And the following syntax to lift a concern when resolved:

```
@rfcbot resolve reason-for-concern
```

MCPs can be seconded using:

```
@rfcbot second
```

##### Who decides whether a concern is unresolved?
Usually the experts in the given area will reach a consensus here, but if there is some
need for a "tie breaker" vote or judgment call, the compiler team leads make the final call.

#### When should MCPs be closed?
MCPs can be closed:

* by the author, if they have lost interest in pursuing it.
* by a team lead or expert, if there are strong objections from key members of the team that
  don't look likely to be overcome.
* by folks doing triage, if there have been three months of inactivity. In this case, people
  should feel free to re-open the issue if they would like to "rejuvenate" it.

### What happens if someone makes a contribution that requires an approval and doesn't have one?
If the approval required for the contribution requires an MCP or an RFC, then the contribution
should be closed or marked as blocked, with a request to create an MCP or RFC first. If approval of
a PR is acceptable for the specific contribution (see below), then the approval process can begin.

### Can I work on code experimentally before a approval is gained?
Of course! You are free to work on PRs or write code. But those PRs should be marked as
experimental and they should not land, nor should anyone be expected to review them (unless
folks want to).

## What makes a good proposal?
A good proposal will address the following:

* **Motivation:** Why is this proposal necessary? What problem does it solve? Why is that problem
  important?
* **Design:** What are you proposing?
* **Implementation notes:** You don't have to talk about the implementation normally, but if there
  are any key things to note (i.e., it was very invasive to implement), you might note them here.
* **Precedent, links, and related material:** Have there been similar proposals on other
  compilers/linkers/tools, like `clang` or `lld`?
* **Alternatives, concerns, and key decisions:** Were there any alernatives considered? If so, why
  did you pick this design?

## What proposal/approval do I need?
This section aims to exhaustively detail which proposal and approval is necessary for any given
circumstance.

### Internal

- Creating [a notification group](./notification-groups.md)
  - **Propose using:** PR
  - **Approve using:** r+
  - If a team member finds the new group reasonable then they can merge the change adding the group.
- Significant internal refactorings/changes
  - **Propose using:** MCP
  - **Approve using:** Seconding
  - Describe your proposed refactorings in detail in an MCP - optionally scheduling a steering
    meeting if more focused discussion is necessary. Once discussion has concluded, a team member
    may second the proposal
- Defining/changing small team policies
  - **Propose using:** MCP
  - **Approve using:** Seconding
  - Examples of smaller policy changes where an MCP would be sufficient include our level of
    support for case-insensitive filesystems or whether the team intend tracking issues to host
    discussion

  - **Propose using:** RFC
  - **Approve using:** FCP
  - Larger policy changes requiring an FCP include proposals to the team's structure and
    membership criteria, etc

### Features

- Adding experimental implementations of not-yet-proposed language features
  - **Propose using:** MCP

    then they can second the MCP and implementation can proceed.
  - This isn't necessary if the owner of the implementation is a member of the compiler team
- Stabilizing a language feature
  - Follow the language team's process and have the stabiization PR reviewed by a member of the
