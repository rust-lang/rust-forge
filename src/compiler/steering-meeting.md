# Compiler-team Steering Meeting

## What is it?

The "steering meeting" is a weekly meeting dedicated to planning and
high-level discussion. The meeting operates on a repeating schedule:

- Week 1: Planning
- Week 2: Technical or non-technical discussion
- Week 3: Technical or non-technical discussion
- Week 4: Non-technical discussion

The first meeting of the 4-week cycle is used for **planning**. The
primary purpose of this meeting is to **select the topics for the next
three meetings**. The topics are selected from a set of topic
proposals, which must be uploaded and available for perusal before the
meeting starts. The planning meeting is also an opportunity to check
on the "overall balance" of our priorities.

The remaining meetings are used for design or general discussion.
Weeks 2 and 3 can be used for **technical** or **non-technical**
discussion; it is also possible to use both weeks to discuss the same
topic, if that topic is complex. **Week 4 is reserved for
non-technical topics**, so as to ensure that we are keeping an eye on
the overall health and functioning of the team.

## Announcing the schedule

After each planning meeting, the topics for the next three weeks are
added to the [compiler-team meeting calendar][c] and a blog post is
posted to the [Inside Rust blog][ir].
