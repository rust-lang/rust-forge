Review Policy
=============

It is the purpose of code reviews to:

- **Reduce** the risk of introducing **bugs** and usability and performance
  **regressions**.
- Keep our code **maintainable**: **readable**, **documented** and
  **well-tested**.
- Ensure that changes are made with the big picture and **appropriate context in
  mind**. This is particularly relevant for changes that seem harmless in
  isolation but are problematic or undesirable in the larger context.

Reviewing accomplishes this by bringing in another set of eyes to look at a
proposed change from a different perspective, which increases the chance of
catching mistakes early and uncovering potential blind spots in the reasoning
behind the change.


## Basic Reviewing Requirements

There are a number of requirements that need to be met in order for reviewing to
be effective:

- Reviewers must have a sufficient **understanding of the code** under review.
  - This is important to help spot non-obvious, unintentional side effects of a
    given change.
- Pull request authors must provide:
  1. A concise high-level **description of the change** and (2) the
     **rationale** behind it, unless the change is extremely trivial, like typo
     fixes.
  2. For the rationale to be even more useful, authors are encouraged to list
     potential **points of contention**, **compromises** that needed to be made,
     **alternative approaches** that have been considered, **relevant
     documentation, discussions and context**, etc.
    - Reviewing code is difficult, and reviewers only have a **limited amount of
      time** to do it. Jump-starting the review process by not making the
      reviewer puzzle together the intention and context of a pull request will
      not only speed things up but also improve the quality of the review.
- Reviewers must have a good idea on whether they are the **right person to
  approve** the change.
  - Knowledge of the code under review is an obvious but not the only criteria
    for answering this question.
  - Procedure wise, the reviewer also needs to decide:
    - Can the reviewer make the decision alone?
    - Does the PR needs to go through the [Major Change Process][mcp], or does
      it need a T-compiler [Final Comment Period][fcp] sign-off, or does it need
      a full [Request For Comments (RFC)][rfc]?
    - Does the PR need reviews and/or sign-off from other teams, particularly
      T-lang?
    - Can the changes break stable code or begin accepting new code that we do
      not intend to? If the PR contains risks, is it sufficiently justified?
      Does the changes need ecosystem impact evaluation through crater runs?
    - Will the PR introduce significant perf changes? If there might be a perf
      regression, is it justified? Does the PR need a perf run? 
    - Can the reviewer perform the review sufficiently thorough and in a timely
      fashion?
    - Is the reviewer impartial enough to provide a sufficiently unbiased
      perspective? E.g. due to co-authorship (sufficiently significant changes
      to the PR made by the reviewer) or other conflicts-of-interest?

## Reviewing Checklist

The following list of questions will help reviewers and PR authors alike to
bring PRs into good shape and meet the above criteria:

> #### Checklist for PR authors and reviewers
> * Does the PR message have
>    * A concise **high-level description** of the changes? (*what* is being
>      changed)
>    * A clear **rationale** for doing them? (*why* is it being changed)

## Guidance for dealing with common situations

In most cases common sense is enough for deciding how to apply this policy.
However, sometimes there are gray areas where it is not immediately clear how to
proceed. This section lists a few common cases together with guidance on how to
deal with them.

### I don't think I am a good fit for reviewing - what now?

It is completely normal that you get (randomly) assigned a PR (via rustbot or
otherwise) but don't feel comfortable reviewing it. Here is what you can do,
depending on the concrete case:

- If the change seems really big or contentious, consider asking for an MCP (see
  below). The reviewer does not and should not be expected to just stomach a
  large and/or significant PR. 
- If you know just the right person for the review, assign them via `r?
  @<github-name>`. It's polite to leave a comment asking them if they can take
  over -- but you don't have to make sure beforehand that they can actually do
  it.
- If the change is not too complicated and you don't expect that another
  randomly rolled compiler reviewer will also have trouble with the PR, you can
  reroll a random compiler reviewer with `r? compiler`.
- If the change is complicated, or you expect randomly rolling another compiler
  reviewer will just lead to multiple rerolls, you should open a thread in
  `#t-compiler/private` to ask the rest of the team -- for someone who might be
  able to review it, or even if the team is comfortable with accepting the
  change at all.
- If the change is intended for another team, roll a reviewer from the relevant
  team.

You can also always ask for help on the `#t-compiler` Zulip stream for finding a
reviewer. That being said, you are always welcome to do an initial review (to
the extent you are comfortable with) and then pass the PR on to the final
reviewer. This way the PR author will get helpful feedback sooner, subsequent
reviewers will have less work to do, and you might also improve your own
understanding of diverse areas in the compiler.

### It is unclear if something constitutes a major change

Deciding if something is a "major change" requiring an [MCP][mcp] is not always
straightforward. The official guidelines are [here][whats-a-major-change]. When
in doubt, err on side of treating something as a major change. You can also
nominate the PR for discussion in the compiler team's triage meeting by tagging
it `I-compiler-nominated`. If you nominate a PR please make sure to state a
**concrete question** for the compiler team to discuss, include **useful
context** if suitable.

> **Example triage meeting nomination message**
> 
> ```text
> Nominating for T-compiler triage meeting to determine if we want to make
> `-Z unstable-options` also accept value(s), e.g. `-Z unstable-options=values` to
> guard *unstable values* of *stable flags* like `-C opt-level=4`.
> 
> Relevant discussion: <https://i.am.a.link>.
> See also #123456.
> 
> @rustbot label +I-compiler-nominated
> ```

### Discussion or rationale is too intransparent

Sometimes there are PRs that seem to be the result of some prior discussion,
with no description or rationale. They usually have a title like "Change X" and
the only content of the PR message is "r? @xyz". Even though the change might
make sense and may even have been suggested by a compiler team member, this is
not good form.

Contributors may stumble across the PR several year later during bisections only
to find the PR with absolutely zero context that was discussed offline or
elsewhere, and the information is not available to future contributors. This is
not good for maintainability. Including relevant context will very often help
the PR author themselves in the future!

The PR message should give a self-contained description of what is being
changed, why it is being changed and anything else that might be of interest.

**Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who, a few years down the road,
needs to fix a bug related to the code touched by the PR and needs to
reconstruct the rationale for the way things are.**

### Reviewer and PR author report to the same entity / work for the same employer

There is no rule that prevents two employees of the same company from reviewing
each other's PRs. We assume compiler team reviewers to act in good faith, and
vest trust in team members to do so.

The concerns in such a case are no different than for any other two reviewers.
We expect the mechanisms and principles we articulated above to be respected by
ALL reviewers, whatever their employer. Does the PR concisely describe the
changes that are being made? Does it give a clear, transparent rationale for why
the changes make sense so that contributors down the line can follow the
reasoning and reconstruct what's going on? Have points of contention been
discussed and cleared up? Then you are in the clear.

If you are in doubt if something is contentious, give a heads up to
`@rust-lang/compiler` and ask for another opinion. If the proposed change is
large and/or potentially has a big impact, you can discuss in a `#t-compiler`
zulip topic, and/or create a [Major Change Proposal][mcp].

### Reviewing and Mentoring

In the course of mentoring someone through a PR it often happens that the
reviewer has ended up effectively co-writing the changes. This can be a tricky
case because the reviewer is effectively approving their own changes. There are
a number of considerations to take into account when deciding how to proceed:

- If the general direction of the changes has already been approved as part of
  an MCP and the concrete advice given during mentoring was only concerned with
  resolving minor technical issues, then no further review is required.
- Similarly, if any contentious decisions have visibly been discussed and
  resolved on the PR with other compiler team members and the rest of the
  changes don't deviate from the general direction that has been agreed upon
  then no further review is required either.
- If the PR was opened as a response to a concrete suggestion by the reviewer
  (and the changes are not entirely trivial) then it is advisable that the final
  review is done by someone else. However, the initial reviewer/mentor is
  encouraged to help bring the PR into good shape before handing it off.

In general, it is advisable to ask for a second opinion by someone knowledgable
in the field in such cases, just to increase the chance of uncovering oversights
and blindspots a mentor might have.

### Nobody understands the code that's being changed

Sometimes there is a bug in some code that nobody understands anymore. The
original authors are unavailable and it is hard to gauge the implications of a
proposed fix. In such a case it is a good idea for reviewers to
`I-compiler-nominate` the PR (if they intend to stay the main reviewer) or
assign a compiler team lead to the issue and add the `S-waiting-on-team` label.

In both cases, the PR will be brought in the weekly triage meeting. It is also
especially valuable to gather and document as much information as possible about
the issue, such as a description of the problem being fixed, points of
unclarity, potential risks, alternatives that have been considered, et cetera.
It is also a good idea to open a tracking issue to document the lack of
understanding of such area, to document the specific questions, concerns and
bugs, and it can be resolved if compiler team members regain better
understanding.

Reviewers should ask PR authors to add this kind of information as comments in
the code and/or to the PR message (which will become part of the git commit
history).

### PR makes a change to support use of rustc internals for external projects

This will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

In general, we should allow changes making things public, cleaning up things or
making them more general, as long as the owners of the compiler region agree (so
just assign to them).

As a concrete example: if someone is using the mir interpreter, and they want to
make something public, it is likely not a problem, but there are some functions
that are module- or crate-private on purpose, as they uphold invariants within
the mir interpreter. So basically, just assign such PRs to the relevant people
(usually they get pinged anyway due to having told highfive that they want to
get pinged on changes to these parts).

Require a doc comment on such APIs identifying which external consumers the API
concerns, and for what kinds of purpose.

If this is possibly contentious, ask for an [mcp].

Note that this can non-obviously bound supposedly-internal compiler APIs to
external consumers. Convey to the external consumers (that are not `rust-lang/`
projects) that we can offer the convenience so as long as it does not impose
significant maintenance burden on the compiler, e.g. gets in the way of
refactorings, and no hard stability guarantees are promised.

### The PR is very large and complicated

Reviewers are **not** expected to stomach PRs that are very large and
complicated. Bring the PR to the attention of the team (through zulip threads
and/or nominate for compiler triage meeting), and the team can decide if:

- The team can find suitable reviewers who can aid the PR author to break up the
  large change into smaller logical PRs that are possible to review on their
  own, but also in the context of the larger change.
- The team does not have the bandwidth, or team members are is not ready or
  willing or able to accept the large change as-is. In such cases, the team
  should make a decision to postpone or close, and clearly communicate the
  decision to the PR author to explain the reasoning. It is very frustrating if
  a PR stalls for many months only for it to be rejected anyway.

## Technical Aspects of Reviewing

Every PR that lands in the compiler and its associated crates must be reviewed
by at least one person who is knowledgeable with the code in question.

When a PR is opened, you can request a reviewer by including `r? @username` in
the PR description. If you don't do so, rustbot will automatically assign
someone from the pool of reviewer candidates, determined by the files affected.

It is common to leave a `r? @username` comment at some later point to request
review from someone else. This will also reassign the PR.

It is possible to request reviews from multiple reviewers, for example

```text
Rolling both a T-compiler and T-bootstrap reviewer as this PR contains both
compiler and bootstrap changes.

r? compiler
r? bootstrap
```

### bors

We never merge PRs directly. Instead, we use bors. A qualified reviewer with
bors privileges (e.g., a [compiler team member](./membership.md)) will leave a
comment like `@bors r+`. This indicates that they approve the PR.

People with bors privileges may also leave a `@bors r=username` command. This
indicates that the PR was already approved by `@username`. This is commonly done
after rebasing.

Finally, in some cases, PRs can be "delegated" by writing `@bors delegate+` or
`@bors delegate=username`. This will allow the PR author or the delegated user
to approve the PR by issuing `@bors` commands like the ones above (but this
privilege is limited to the single PR).

### Reverts

If a merged PR is found to have caused a meaningful unanticipated regression,
the best policy is to revert it quickly and re-land it later once a fix and
regression test are added.

A "meaningful regression" in this case is up to the judgment of the person
approving the revert.

Some criteria to consider if a revert is warranted:

- A bug in a stable or otherwise important feature that causes code to stop
  compiling, changes runtime behavior, or triggers a (warn-by-default or higher)
  lint incorrectly in real-world code. Especially if the bug is reachable
  without any unstable feature gates.
- If a bug or change (incl. ICEs) is particularly easy to hit.
- If a bug or change significantly degrades contributor experience.
- If a test is flaky and unreliable.

When these criteria are in doubt, and especially if real-world code is affected,
revert the PR. This has three benefits:

1. It allows bleeding edge users (esp. nightly or beta) to continue to use and
  report bugs on HEAD with a higher degree of certainty about where new bugs are
  introduced.
2. It takes pressure off the original PR author and the team, that no one is
   pressured to feel like they have to fix it *immediately*.
3. It might prevent the significant bug or regression from reaching another
   nightly/beta/stable build.

Before being reverted, a PR should be shown to cause a regression with a fairly
high degree of certainty (e.g. bisection on commits, or bisection on nightlies
with one or more compiler team members pointing to this PR, or it's simply
obvious to everyone involved). Only revert with lower certainty if the issue is
particularly critical or urgent to fix.

#### Creating reverts

The easiest method for creating a revert is to use the "Revert" button on
Github. This appears next to the "bors merged commit abcd" message on a pull
request, and creates a new pull request.

![Location of the "Revert" button](revert-button.png)

Alternatively, a revert commit can be created using the git CLI and then
uploaded as a pull request:

```terminal
$ git revert -m 1 62d5bee
```

Don't rely *only* on the default commit title and message created by git.
Instead, title the revert commit meaningfully, and link to the relevant PR that
introduced the regression. Link to the specific PR that is being fully or
partially reverted. Link to relevant issues and discussions. Retain the commit
hash being reverted.

> **Example revert commit title and message**
> 
> ```text
> Revert #131669 due to ICEs
> 
> Revert <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131669> due to ICE
> reports:
> 
> - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/134059> (real-world)
> - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/134060> (fuzzing)
> 
> The changes can be re-landed with those cases addressed.
> 
> This reverts commit 703bb982303ecab02fec593899639b4c3faecddd, reversing
> changes made to f415c07494b98e4559e4b13a9c5f867b0e6b2444.
> ```

It's polite to tag the author and reviewer of the original PR so they know
what's going on. You can use the following message template for the revert PR
description:

```text
Reverts rust-lang/rust#123456
cc @author @reviewer

This revert is based on the following report of a regression caused by this PR:
<link to issue or comment(s)>

In accordance with the compiler team [revert policy], PRs that cause meaningful
regressions should be reverted and re-landed once the regression has been fixed
(and a regression test has been added, where appropriate).
[revert policy]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/reviews.html#reverts

Fear not! Regressions happen. Please rest assured that this does not
represent a negative judgment of your contribution or ability to contribute
positively to Rust in the future. We simply want to prioritize keeping existing
use cases working, and keep the compiler more stable for everyone.

r? compiler
```

Please include a temporary regression test in a separate commit to check that
the regression is actually addressed by the revert commit. In a reland, this
temporary regression test can be adapted or removed following improved test
coverage as suitable.

If you have r+ privileges, you can self-approve a revert **if** the revert is
clean and is unlikely to cause new regressions on its own, make sure the revert
is not a case of "the cure is worse than the poison". If non-trivial, please
wait for a review -- from the original reviewer or from another compiler
reviewer via `r? compiler`. You can ask in `#t-compiler` if the matter is more
urgent.

Generally speaking, reverts should have elevated priority and match the `rollup`
status of the PR they are reverting. If a non-rollup PR is shown to have no
impact on performance, it can be marked `rollup=always`. The revert author can
coordinate with contributors authoring rollups to reschedule rollups or
interleave the revert PR between rollups if suitable.

#### Forward fixes

Often it is tempting to address a regression by posting a follow-up PR that,
rather than reverting the regressing PR, instead augments the original in small
ways without reverting its changes overall. However, if real-world users have
reported being affected, this practice is strongly discouraged unless one of the
following is true:

* A high-confidence fix is already in the bors queue.
* The regression has made it to a release branch (beta or stable) and a
  [backport] is needed. Often the "smallest possible change" is desired for a
  backport (so that the fix doesn't introduce *new* regressions). The offending
  PR may or may not still be reverted on the main branch; this is left to the
  discretion of someone who can `r+` it.

[backport]: ../release/backporting.md

While it can feel like a significant step backward to have your PR reverted, in
most cases it is much easier to reland the PR once a fix can be confirmed.
Allowing a revert to land takes pressure off of you and your reviewers to act
quickly and gives you time to address the issue fully. It also is an opportunity
to take a step back and reassess the test coverage.

### Rollups

All reviewers are strongly encouraged to explicitly mark a PR as to whether or
not it should be part of a [rollup]. This is usually done either when approving
a PR with `@bors r+ $ROLLUP_STATUS` or with `@bors $ROLLUP_STATUS` where
`$ROLLUP_STATUS` is substituted with one of the following:

- `rollup=always`: These PRs are very unlikely to break tests or have
  performance implications. Example scenarios:
  - Changes are limited to documentation, comments, etc. that is highly
    unlikely to fail a build.
  - Changes cannot have performance implications.
  - Your PR is not landing possibly-breaking or behavior altering changes.
    - Feature stabilization without other changes is likely fine to rollup,
      though.
  - When in doubt do not use this option!
- `rollup=maybe`: This is the default if `@bors r+` does not specify any rollup
  status at all. Use this if you have some doubt that the change won't break
  tests. This can be used if you aren't sure if it should be one of the other
  categories. Since this is the default, there is usually no need to explicitly
  specify this, unless you are un-marking the rollup level from a previous
  command.
- `rollup=iffy`: Use this for mildly risky PRs (more risky than "maybe").
  Example scenarios:
  - The PR is large and non-additive (note: adding 2000 lines of completely
    new tests is fine to rollup).
  - Has platform-specific changes that are not checked by the normal PR
    checks.
  - May be affected by MIR migrate mode.
- `rollup=never`: This should *never* be included in a rollup (**please**
  include a comment explaining why you have chosen this). Example scenarios:
  - May have performance implications.
  - May cause unclear regressions (we would likely want to bisect to this PR
    specifically, as it would be hard to identify as the cause from a rollup).
  - Has a high chance of failure.
  - Is otherwise dangerous to rollup.
    - Messes too much with:
    - LLVM or code generation
    - bootstrap or the build system
    - build-manifest
- `rollup`: this is equivalent to `rollup=always`
- `rollup-`: this is equivalent to `rollup=maybe`

### Priority

Reviewers are encouraged to set one of the rollup statuses listed above instead
of setting priority. Bors automatically sorts based on the rollup status (never
is the highest priority, always is the lowest), and also by PR age. If you do
change the priority, please use your best judgment to balance fairness and
urgency with other PRs.

The following is some guidance for setting priorities:

- 1-5
    - P-high issue fixes
    - Toolstate fixes
    - Reverts containing the above
    - Beta-nominated PRs
    - Submodule/Subtree updates
- 5+
    - P-critical issue fixes
- 10+
    - Bitrot-prone PRs (particularly very large ones that touch many files)
    - Urgent PRs (e.g. urgent reverts)
    - Beta backports
- 20+
    - High priority that needs to jump ahead of any rollups
    - Fixes or changes something that has a high risk of being re-broken by
      another PR in the queue.
- 1000
    - Absolutely critical fixes
    - Release promotions

### Expectations for r+

bors privileges are binary: the bot doesn't know which code you are familiar
with and what code you are not. They must therefore be used with discretion. Do
not r+ code that you do not know well -- you can definitely **review** such
code, but try to hand off reviewing to someone else for the final r+.

Similarly, never issue a `r=username` command unless that person has done the
review, and the code has not changed substantially since the review was done,
and that the person has explicitly indicated that another contributor can `r=`
on their behalf.

Rebasing is fine and often necessary, but changes in functionality typically
require re-review. It is very helpful for the reviewer if the PR author can
produce a brief summary of what has changed since last review, in addition to
responding to individual review comments.

Please refer to [bors documentation for bot usage](../infra/docs/bors.md).

## Social aspects of reviewing

First and foremost, PR authors and compiler reviews alike are expected to uphold
the [Code of Conduct][coc]. Simply speaking, a reviewer is expected to be
respectful to the PR author, even if the reviewer disagrees with the changes.

Reviewers are encouraged to consider matters from the perspectives of the PR
author too. If a change is stuck due to procedural reasons or reviewer bandwidth
for months without any resolution (including a resolution that the compiler
might not be ready to accept such a change at present time, but thank the PR
author for the contributions anyway), and accrues constant merge conflicts, it
can be very frustrating.

If some discussions are getting heated, ask the [moderation
team](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/moderation) to step in.
