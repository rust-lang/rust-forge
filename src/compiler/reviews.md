# Review policies

Every PR that lands in the compiler and its associated crates must be
reviewed by at least one person who is knowledgeable with the code in
question.

When a PR is opened, you can request a reviewer by including `r?
@username` in the PR description. If you don't do so, rustbot
will automatically assign someone.

It is common to leave a `r? @username` comment at some later point to
request review from someone else. This will also reassign the PR.

## bors

We never merge PRs directly. Instead, we use bors. A qualified
reviewer with bors privileges (e.g., a [compiler
contributor](./membership.md)) will leave a comment like `@bors r+`.
This indicates that they approve the PR.

People with bors privileges may also leave a `@bors r=username`
command. This indicates that the PR was already approved by
`@username`. This is commonly done after rebasing.

Finally, in some cases, PRs can be "delegated" by writing `@bors
delegate+` or `@bors delegate=username`. This will allow the PR author
to approve the PR by issuing `@bors` commands like the ones above
(but this privilege is limited to the single PR).

## Rollups

All reviewers are strongly encouraged to explicitly mark a PR as to whether or
not it should be part of a [rollup] with one of the following:

- `rollup=always`: These PRs are very unlikely to break tests or have performance
  implications. Example scenarios:
    - Changes are limited to documentation, comments, etc. that is highly
      unlikely to fail a build.
    - Changes cannot have performance implications.
    - Your PR is not landing possibly-breaking or behavior altering changes.
        - Feature stabilization without other changes is likely fine to
          rollup, though.
- `rollup=maybe`: This is the **default** if you do not specify a rollup
  status. Use this if you don't have much confidence that it won't break
  tests. This can be used if you aren't sure if it should be one of the other
  categories. Since this is the default, there is usually no need to
  explicitly specify this, unless you are un-marking the rollup level from a
  previous command.
- `rollup=iffy`: Use this for mildly risky PRs (more risky than "maybe").
  Example scenarios:
    - The PR is large and non-additive (note: adding 2000 lines of completely
      new tests is fine to rollup).
    - Messes too much with:
        - LLVM or code generation
        - bootstrap or the build system
        - build-manifest
    - Has platform-specific changes that are not checked by the normal PR checks.
    - May be affected by MIR migrate mode.
- `rollup=never`: This should *never* be included in a rollup (**please**
  include a comment explaining why you have chosen this). Example scenarios:
    - May have performance implications.
    - May cause unclear regressions (we would likely want to bisect to this PR
      specifically, as it would be hard to identify as the cause from a
      rollup).
    - Has a high chance of failure.
    - Is otherwise dangerous to rollup.

## Priority

Reviewers are encouraged to set one of the rollup statuses listed above
instead of setting priority. Bors automatically sorts based on the rollup
status (never is the highest priority, always is the lowest), and also by PR
age. If you do change the priority, please use your best judgment to balance
fairness with other PRs.

The following is some guidance for setting priorities:

- 1-5
    - P-high issue fixes
    - Toolstate fixes
    - Beta-nominated PRs
    - Submodule/Subtree updates
- 5+
    - P-critical issue fixes
- 10+
    - Bitrot-prone PRs (particularly very large ones that touch many files)
    - Urgent PRs
    - Beta backports
- 20+
    - High priority that needs to jump ahead of any rollups
    - Fixes or changes something that has a high risk of being re-broken by
      another PR in the queue.
- 1000
    - Absolutely critical fixes
    - Release promotions

## Expectations for r+

bors privileges are binary: the bot doesn't know which code you are
familiar with and what code you are not. They must therefore be used
with discretion. Do not r+ code that you do not know well -- you can
definitely **review** such code, but try to hand off reviewing to
someone else for the final r+.

Similarly, never issue a `r=username` command unless that person has
done the review, and the code has not changed substantially since the
review was done.  Rebasing is fine, but changes in functionality
typically require re-review (though it's a good idea to try and
highlight what has changed, to help the reviewer).
