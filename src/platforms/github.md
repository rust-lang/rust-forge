## Administration FAQ

> Who administrates the `rust-lang` organisation?

All core team members have the `admin` role.

> How do I create a new repository under the `rust-lang` organisation, or make
  changes that require `admin` level permissions?

You can contact a GitHub admin directly, or post the request in [`project leads
(public)`] stream on Zulip and an admin will be able to respond to your request
there.
