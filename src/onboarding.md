# Onboarding to the Project

This document is a starting point for a new team member (or a refresh for
existing team members) on things that are useful to know as a member of the
project, in particular in terms of where to raise concerns or get help.

## Relationship to Council

The Leadership Council formally takes positions on behalf of the Project when
needed. All Rust project members are officially represented by approximately
one member of the council (some teams parent up to two or more members).

Generally speaking, any concerns you have that are either more widely
applicable (i.e., not just your team) or you feel aren't being fully handled
within your team can be escalated to the Council. Note that interpersonal
concerns and/or code of conduct violations should always be directed to the
Moderation team.

Escalating to the Council can be done via:

- Zulip, on [#council](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/392734-council)
- Zulip DM, to your council representative (see
  [council](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/leadership-council) for
  which team each representative represents).

Either can be a reasonable starting point, please select what you feel more
comfortable with, though bias towards being public.

Leadership Council positions are elected by the Project teams on a rotating
calendar, see [Council term limits] for more details.

## Relationship to Foundation

The Foundation works to support the project, and the project has direct
representation on the Foundation's board (the 5 project directors). Those
directors are selected by the Leadership Council per the [bylaws].

Those directors have 50% of the vote on any Board vote in the Foundation,
regardless of the number of non-Project directors.

The website has the [current project directors].

Please reach out whether you're just interested, have questions, or have concerns in:

- Zulip, on [#foundation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/335408-foundation)
- To the Council (see above)
- To one of the Project Directors (see member list above), recommending Zulip
  DM as an initial point
