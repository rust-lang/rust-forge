# Bors

The infrastructure team manages an instance of [Homu] called "Bors", to be used
for `rust-lang/rust`. The instance is available
at [bors.rust-lang.org], and is backed by the [@bors] GitHub account.

The service is configured [with Terraform][tf], and it's automatically deployed
from the [rust-lang/homu] repository onto our [ECS cluster][ecs].

## Maintenance procedures

### Fixing inconsistencies in the queue

Homu is quite buggy, and it might happen that the queue doesn't reflect the
actual state in the repositories.

See [Fixing inconsistencies in the bors queue](./bors/queue-resync.md) for
instructions on how to do this properly.

### Adding a new repository to bors

There are multiple steps needed to add a repository to our Bors instance:

1. The [@bors] GitHub account needs to be granted write access to the
   repository.

2. Each CI provider needs to have a single GitHub Check Run to gate on. This is
   not provided by default on GitHub Actions, but it can be simulated with
   these two jobs, which will generate a `bors build finished` check:

   ```yaml
   end-success:
     name: bors build finished
     if: success()
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: [ALL, OTHER, JOBS]
     steps:
       - name: Mark the job as successful
         run: exit 0

   end-failure:
     name: bors build finished
     if: "!success()"
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: [ALL, OTHER, JOBS]
     steps:
       - name: Mark the job as a failure
         run: exit 1
   ```

   Make sure to replace `[ALL, OTHER, JOBS]` with a list of all the jobs you
   want to gate on.

   These jobs need to run on specific branches (`auto` and `try`) so it's necessary
   to add those branches to the list of branches tested by the CI provider. For GitHub
   Actions that looks like this:

   ```yaml
   on:
      push:
          branches: [ 
            auto,   # Added for bors
            try     # Added for bors
         ]
   ```

3. Add the repository name to the bors permissions array in the [team
   repository][team-permissions.rs], and grant the `bors.REPOSITORY.review`
   permission to the right teams or people. You can see an example of adding
   bors permissions to a team [here][bors-permission].

4. Add the repository to the `repositories` map in [the Terraform configuration
   file][tf-repos]. This will create a webhook and inject its secret key in the
   bors execution environment.

5. Add the repository to the [Bors configuration][bors-config], taking
   inspiration from other repositories. Note that the environment variables used
   in that config will be set automatically as long as you completed step 3 above.

6. Give it a test by commenting `@bors ping` in any PR. If you get a response back,
   you can then try to approve the PR with `@bors r+`.
