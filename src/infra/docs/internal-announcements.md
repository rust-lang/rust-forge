# Internal-facing infrastructure announcements

For significant _internal facing_ infrastructure changes or updates, the Infrastructure Team can
announce that change in the infrastructure announcement Zulip channel [`#t-infra/announcements`].
Please keep in mind that we would like to keep that channel to be _low traffic_ and have a _high
signal-to-noise ratio_.

By _internal facing_, we mean infrastructure that primarily is used by or only impacts project team
members and other specific project-internal users (such as [Dev Desktop](./dev-desktop.md) users).
