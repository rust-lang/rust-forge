# RFC Merge Procedure
Once an RFC has been accepted (i.e., the final comment period is complete, and
no major issues were raised), it must be merged. Right now this is a manual
process, though just about anyone can do it (if you're not a subteam member,
though, you'll have to open a PR rather than merge the RFC manually). Here is
the complete set of steps to merge an RFC -- in some cases, not all the steps
will be applicable.

### Step 1: Open tracking issue

Open a tracking issue over on rust-lang/rust. Here is a template for the issue
text. You'll have to adjust the various places labeled XXX with some suitable
content (e.g., the name of the RFC, or the most appropriate team).

```markdown
This is a tracking issue for the RFC "XXX" (rust-lang/rfcs#NNN).

**Steps:**

- [ ] Implement the RFC (cc @rust-lang/XXX -- can anyone write up mentoring
      instructions?)
- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])
- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])

[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr
[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs

**Unresolved questions:**

XXX --- list all the "unresolved questions" found in the RFC to ensure they are
not forgotten
```

Add the following labels to the issue:

- `B-rfc-approved`
- `C-tracking-issue`
- the appropriate `T-XXX` label

(If you don't have permissions to do so, leave a note cc'ing the appropriate
team and asking them to do so.)

### Step 2: Merge the RFC PR itself

In your local git checkout:

- Merge the RFC PR into master in your fork
- Add a commit that moves the file name from 0000- to its RFC number
- Edit the new file to include links to the RFC PR and the tracking issue you
  just created in the header
- Open a PR or push directly to the master branch on rust-lang/rfcs, as
  appropriate

### Step 3: Leave a comment

Leave a final comment on the PR directing everyone to the tracking issue.
Something like this, but feel free to add your own personal flavor (and change
the team):

```markdown
**Huzzah!** The @rust-lang/lang team has decided **to accept** this RFC.

To track further discussion, subscribe to the tracking issue here:
rust-lang/rust#41517
```

### That's it, you're done!
